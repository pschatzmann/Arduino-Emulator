# An Arduino C++ Emulator Library

## Using this Project as a library

If you have an Arduino Sketch that you want to run e.g in Linux, OS/X or Windows you can include this library with cmake. 
Here is an [example cmake file](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools/blob/main/examples/examples-desktop/generator/CMakeLists.txt) for a [Arduino Audio Sketch](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools/tree/main/examples/examples-desktop/generator)).

## GPIO/SPI/I2C

We provide some alternative implementations:

- Dummy Implementatin which does nothing
- Communicates changes to/from a Microcontroller using UDP
- Rasperry PI 


## Jupyter

I really wanted to have an interactive [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) environemnt in which I could play around with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) commands and when I discovered that Arduino provides a good starting point with their [ArduinoCore-API](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API/tree/105276f8d81413391b14a3dc6c80180ee9e33d56) I decided to start this project.

You can also use [xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling) as a runtime environment to simulate an Arduino Development board and I have added the missing implementation using C or the C++ std library.

Here is a quick demo:

- [Setup](01-Setup.ipynb)
- [Introduction into some Basic Commands](02-BasicCommands.ipynb)
- [The Network Stack](03-Network.ipynb)
- [Using Pins](04-Pins.ipynb)
- [Using Serial](05-Serial.ipynb)
