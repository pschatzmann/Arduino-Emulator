/**
 * @brief UDP Stream implementation for single-target communication
 *
 * WiFiUDPStream extends WiFiUDP to provide a stream-like interface for UDP
 * communication with a single target endpoint. It automatically manages packet
 * boundaries and provides buffered read/write operations suitable for streaming
 * protocols over UDP.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Stream-based UDP communication with automatic packet management
 * - Single target endpoint configuration (IP address and port)
 * - Automatic target discovery from incoming packets when target unknown
 * - Buffered operations with flush-triggered packet transmission
 * - Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
 * - Integration with WiFiUDP for underlying network operations
 * 
 * The class maintains an internal target address and automatically begins/ends
 * UDP packets as needed. Data is sent when flush() is called, making it suitable
 * for protocols that require message boundaries or batch transmission.
 *

 * @see IPAddress
